*Collins Mosita Moringa* | Mr. Collins Misita Morang’a is a Bioinformatics Scientist at WACCBIP. He was a PhD research fellow at WACCBIP, funded by the Wellcome Trust DELTAS Programme at the University of Ghana. He finished his studies in Biochemistry from Egerton University and obtained his Master of Science Degree in Molecular Biology from Maseno University in Kenya. In his Ph.D., he is interested in using artificial intelligence approaches to classify the malaria infections, as well as deconvolution of transcriptomics and genomics data from asymptomatic and clinical malaria individuals. The secondary focus of his Ph.D. research is to identify regulatory mechanisms that dampen the activation of the Type I interferon pathway by sensing Plasmodium DNA during malaria infections. The regulation checkpoints can provide opportunities for therapeutic interventions against clinical malaria. | ![](https://github.com/mbbu/Mentorship_Program/blob/main/assets/images/Collins.jpg) | | [Website](https://collinsmisitamoranga.com/)

Subsequently he pursued a PhD in Biochemistry (Human Genetics) funded by the Wellcome Trust DELTAS PhD Fellowship at WACCBIP, University of Ghana with Research component at the Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics (WHG), University of Oxford, UK. His PhD focused on the molecular characterization of GYPB gene deletions and their function effect on Plasmodium falciparum invasion of erythrocytes and growth of the parasite. With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dominic contributes to genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in Ghana through viral sequencing and analysis as a Bioinformatician at West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens where analysis and research outcomes are communicated through publications, weekly or monthly updates and national policy briefs on COVID-19 for Ghana. He is also part of Africa CDC Genomic Surveillance Team for the tracking and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2. Dominic S. Y. Amuzu's current post doctoral research is focused on Human Genetics and the Epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum across malaria endemic regions in Africa. The main goal is to develop a comprehensive profile of host receptor diversity across a gradient of malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa to facilitate the understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in malaria infection as well as the biology of the parasite for therapeutic strategies again the parasite. | ![](https://github.com/mbbu/Mentorship_Program/blob/main/assets/images/Dominic.jpeg) | | [Website](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/amuzu.dominic-selorm-yao)
*Ademola Ayeinuro* | He completed his MPhil in Pathology at the University of Cambridge and currently working as a research assistant in the same laboratory. Ademola’s research interests include epithelial homeostasis and the cervical transformation zone. During his MPhil, Ademola investigated the cellular origin of cervical precancer and explored the reasons for disease recurrence in different groups of women. He discovered that the globally adopted treatment for cervical precancer does not necessarily prevent a recurrent or incident disease, a topic that he is further exploring for his PhD. As a team lead at Research4Knowledge, Ademola is very keen to contribute his knowledge and skills in improving bioscience education in Africa. He seeks to be a leading researcher in cancer biology and immunology, thereby creating innovations in cancer biology for improved diagnosis in Africa. | ![](https://github.com/mbbu/Mentorship_Program/blob/main/assets/images/Ademola.jpeg)| [Ademola's presentation](https://github.com/mbbu/Mentorship_Program/blob/main/assets/presentations/Ademola.pptx) |  |
