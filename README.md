# Mentorship_Program

In an effort to provide high-quality personalized mentoring to the ICIPE Bioinformatics interns alumnus, we sought to continue with the bioinformatics mentorship programme. The programme will provide a platform for connecting, sharing ideas, providing feedback and being part of peer mentorship groups as a way of enabling each one of us to keep track of our progress in the science career.

We will be holding quarterly meetings and if need be monthly meetings to catch up and offer assistance. We will also invite third party individuals who have secured Masters/PhDs/Jobs within and outside the country to share their journey and offer guidance on their application experiences.
